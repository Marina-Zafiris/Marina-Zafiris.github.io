As an undergraduate student, I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Data Science with a double minor in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Houston- Downtown.  Despite the countless applications of Data Science, I have a special interest in machine learning, complexity studies and computational sustainability.
